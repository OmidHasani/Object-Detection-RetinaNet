"In this project, I used a combination of the 2017 VOC and 2017 COCO datasets for object detection. For the deep learning model, I utilized the RetinaNet architecture, introduced in 2018. You can find the link to the paper here:
RetinaNet Paper.

I implemented the entire architecture from scratch in the code. For the backbone, I used a ResNet-50 network. In this model, ResNet-50 is first used for feature extraction, followed by an FPN (Feature Pyramid Network), which then branches into two separate networks: one for classification to detect objects, and the other for regression to predict bounding boxes.

To run this project, all the necessary libraries should be installed on your system, and then you can execute the code."
